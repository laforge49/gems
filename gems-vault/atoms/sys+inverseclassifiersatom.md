# Sys+InverseClassifierAtom

Entries are added to the [referencemap](../basics/referencemap.md) held by the sys+inverseclassifieratom of the [context](../basics/context.md) of a [gem](../basics/gem.md) for every classifier of that gem when the gem is created.

The keys of these entries are the [ids](../basics/id.md) of the classifiers and the data elements are vectors of the ids of the gems which use those classifiers.
