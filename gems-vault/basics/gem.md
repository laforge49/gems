# Gem

Gems are the principal data structure in the gems framework. Gems can operate asynchronously as individuals or synchronously within a [federation](basics/federation.md).

Gems can be accessed either by an [id](basics/id.md) or a [reference](basics/reference.md). And within a [context](basics/context.md) by their [name](basics/name.md).

The data structure of a gem is partitioned into multiple facets, including descriptors, classifiers, relations.
