# Atom

An [atom](https://clojure.org/reference/atoms) is a wrapper of mutable data (state) that facilitates sharing between [go blocks](goblock.md). Atoms allow state to be updated atomically, providing the state is all under a single atom.

In the gems framework, atoms are found in [env](env.md) and [gems](gem.md).
