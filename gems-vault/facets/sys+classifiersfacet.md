# Sys+ClassifiersFacet

A sys+classifierfacet holds all the classifiers of a [gem](../basics/gem.md). It is immutable and is initialized when a gem is created.

Classifiers are inverted in the [sys+inverseclassifiersatoms](../atoms/sys+inverseclassifiersatom.md) of the [contexts](../basics/context.md) of the gems which have a given classifier.
