# Introduction to Gems

Gems is an experimental framework for knowledge applications. The API is intended to be rich in advanced features, but the scope is restricted to a single host and a moderately sized dataset. Multi-threading is supported, and serialization is done using [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).
